### iOS & Full-Stack Developer · New York City

I build production software for creative work that happens in real time —
native iOS apps, full-stack web products, and tools that run live comedy shows
and film shoots while they are happening.

## The code in this repository

[![CI](https://github.com/taylordrew4u2/taylordrew4u2/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/taylordrew4u2/taylordrew4u2/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This repo is both my profile and a working product:
**[pinsandneedlescomedy.com](https://pinsandneedlescomedy.com)**, the site for a
live stand-up show in Ridgewood, Queens, and the admin its producers use to run
it. Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind 4 — **and no database.**

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/home.png" alt="The Pins &amp; Needles Comedy home page: the line-art logo, the section nav, and a pink banner announcing the weekly show with a call to send a decision in." width="860">
</p>

It is worth a look because the constraints are real rather than illustrative:
the people editing it are comedians on a phone, the audience hits it forty at a
time during one bar hour, and it has to cost nothing to run.

### The show page, and the panel that runs the show

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">
<img src="docs/images/bad-decisions.png" alt="The Bad Decisions page: show time, venue, and a notice reading Submissions open an hour before the show." width="100%">
<br><em>The audience page. The form only exists in the hour around the show — the rest of the week it says when it opens.</em>
</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">
<img src="docs/images/admin.png" alt="The admin Bad Decisions tab: a Tonight panel with a live count, Draw one, Refresh and Archive everything buttons, above the page's own settings." width="100%">
<br><em>What the host has open on stage. Draw one picks at random on the server, so two phones can never pull the same submission.</em>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### How a decision gets from the room to the stage

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  QR["QR code on the table"] --> Form["/bad-decisions form"]
  SMS["Text message"] --> Voice["Google Voice"]
  Voice -->|forwards by email| Relay["Apps Script relay"]

  Form --> Public["POST /api/decisions"]
  Relay -->|POST with shared secret| Inbound["POST /api/decisions/inbound"]

  Public --> Gate{"Inside the submission window?"}
  Inbound --> Gate
  Gate -->|no| Closed["Refused, and told when it opens"]
  Gate -->|yes| Store[("One file per submission")]

  Store --> Panel["Admin, Tonight panel"]
  Panel --> Draw["Draw one at random"]
```
Every way in enforces the same window and the same sanitising, because the
endpoint is what a QR code points at — the form is not a gate, it is a
convenience. Texting in needs no mailbox password anywhere: the site holds one
secret scoped to one endpoint, and a
[small relay script](docs/relay/gmail-apps-script.gs) posts to it.

### What is actually interesting here

- **Content is one JSON document merged over compiled-in defaults**, so a new
  field ships without a migration and a fresh deploy is already a finished site.
  Three interchangeable storage drivers — local filesystem, a private GitHub
  repo via the Contents API, or Vercel Blob — selected by which secrets exist.
- **Audience submissions are one file each.** Forty people scanning the same QR
  code in the same minute would lose writes against a shared array, so there is
  nothing to contend over.
- **Reads are driven by what a listing already tells you.** The admin polls
  every fifteen seconds for the length of a show; re-reading every file was
  measured at **14,640 GitHub API requests an hour against a 5,000 limit**, so
  the panel would have started failing mid-show. Each listing entry carries a
  content hash, so only files that actually changed are read — **240 an hour**,
  at any pile size.
- **Show times are New York wall-clock**, resolved against the zone's real
  offset for the date, so the DST changeover needs no maintenance.
- **The admin fails closed.** Credential policy lives in a module with no
  framework imports — so it is tested directly — and without both secrets set in
  production, every login is refused and every cookie stops verifying.
- **194 tests on the Node test runner.** No test framework and no transpile
  step, because the logic worth testing lives in plain modules. CI runs lint,
  typecheck, tests and a production build on every pull request.

## Stack

- **iOS** — Swift, SwiftUI, SwiftData, CloudKit, on-device transcription and AI
- **Web** — Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, PWAs
- **Backend** — Node.js, REST APIs, PostgreSQL, Turso, Prisma, Drizzle
- **Engineering** — authentication and session security, client-side encryption,
  offline sync, payments, testing, CI/CD, technical writing

## How I work

I try to write software that is still legible a year after launch, and to be
specific in the code about *why* something is the way it is — the storage
layout, the failure direction of an auth check, the option that was rejected and
what it would have cost. Most of the work I enjoy is turning a messy operational
process into a tool someone can trust while they are in the middle of using it.

product problems — New York City or remote.
