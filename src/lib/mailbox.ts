 * client. That matters more than it sounds: IMAP identifies a message two
 * different ways — by sequence number, which shifts as the mailbox changes,
 * and by UID, which does not — and every call in a pass has to agree on which
 * one it is being handed. Disagreeing marks the wrong message read and leaves
 * the real one unread, so the next poll reads it again.
