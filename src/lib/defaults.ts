  about: {
    heading: "About Us",
    intro: "Tattoo culture meets stand-up comedy.",
    story: `Pins & Needles Comedy is an NYC-based stand-up showcase operating just outside the traditional club circuit, with a sensibility shaped by tattoo culture and alternative comedy scenes. The show pairs strong, contemporary stand-up with a distinct visual identity, creating something that feels both deliberate and unmistakably of its moment.

Hosted and produced by Taylor Drew and Justin Hartmann.

Under the tagline "Strip Down for Stand-Up," tattooed comedians perform in minimal clothing — not as a stunt, but as a structural choice that strips away artifice and keeps the focus on the work. The result is a confident, fully produced show that reflects the evolving tone of New York comedy: direct, unpolished in the right ways, and rooted in voice rather than convention.

## Exactly what it is

Every performer appears onstage in minimal stagewear. Their bodies and tattoos are fully visible and intentionally part of the performance. This visual element is not optional, and it is not a side gimmick — it is the defining structure of the show.

Pins & Needles is not a burlesque show, a strip show, or an open mic. It is professionally produced stand-up comedy. The comedians are experienced performers delivering full sets. The difference is that the audience is not just listening; they are also watching.

## Format

- Curated lineup of experienced stand-up comedians
- Each performer appears onstage in limited clothing for their full set
- Structured hosting and controlled pacing
- No audience participation required
- No nudity beyond agreed-upon stagewear
- Clear run of show with defined start and end times

## Production

Standard microphone and sound system, basic stage lighting, minimal setup and breakdown, and a self-contained production team. The show is tightly run and venue-friendly — it works in bars, theaters, art spaces, and alternative venues that want programming that stands out without becoming unmanageable.`,
